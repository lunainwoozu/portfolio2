WHAT'S IN THE SERIES?
STUDIO CLASSIC
A portable replica of the classic JCM800 2203 which was originally introduced in the 80¡¯s. At the time, it offered more overdrive, making it a heavy metal hero. With a roar rivalling that of the king of the jungle, it¡¯s played by some of the greatest rock musicians of all time. The Studio Classic is available as a 20W head or combo.

STUDIO JUBILEE
A small version of the Silver Jubilee. Originally released in 1987 to mark 25 years of Marshall the Silver Jubilee became a favourite with guitar legends such as Slash and John Frusciante for its ferocious tone and split-channel design. The Studio version is available as a 20W head or combo.

STUDIO VINTAGE
Based on the vintage JMP 1959SLP which was the amp that defined classic rock tone, with its plexiglass panel seen on the 100W amps in the late 60¡¯s. It was considered a sonic essential by many famous guitarists for its sheer power and tonal possibility. The Studio Vintage is available as a 20W head or combo.
